## Overview

This is a simple 3D jigsaw puzzle designed to test and assess a player's ability and speed in solving a puzzle. Letâ€™s dive into the details:

- **Randomized puzzle images**: Each time the player restarts the game, it will present them with a different puzzle image from a set of chosen puzzle images.

- **Scores**: The game keeps track of how many moves the user made as well as the time it took the player to finish the puzzle.
  
- **Simple Visuals**: Mainly to add to the immersion of the player.
